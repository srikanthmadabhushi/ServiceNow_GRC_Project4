# EX360-AIDG – AI Decision Governance for Enterprise Risk & Resilience

## Overview
EX360-AIDG is a ServiceNow-based AI decision governance framework designed to make
enterprise AI decisions **trustworthy, auditable, and executive-ready**.

The solution unifies **BCM and SecOps risk signals**, applies **confidence scoring**,
enforces **human-in-the-loop approvals**, and provides **executive-level visibility**
into AI-driven decisions.

---

## Business Problem
Organizations increasingly use AI across ITSM, SecOps, and BCM.  
However, leadership often hesitates to trust AI decisions due to:
- Lack of explainability
- No confidence indicators
- Missing human approval mechanisms
- Poor auditability

---

## Solution
EX360-AIDG introduces a **decision-grade AI governance layer** that:
- Correlates BCM and SecOps signals
- Generates explainable AI recommendations
- Assigns confidence scores
- Requires explicit human approval
- Maintains a full audit trail
- Presents outcomes through executive dashboards

---

## Architecture Overview
**Layers**
1. Enterprise Risk Signals (BCM, SecOps)
2. AI Decision Intelligence (server-side logic)
3. Decision Governance (confidence + approvals)
4. Executive Engagement (dashboards & narratives)

---

## Key Features
- AI Decision Log (governance-first data model)
- Confidence-based decision escalation
- Human-in-the-loop approvals via Flow Designer
- Cross-domain (BCM + SecOps) risk correlation
- Executive dashboard for oversight and reporting

---

## Governance & Trust
The solution follows enterprise AI governance principles:
- AI recommendations are **not autonomous**
- High-confidence decisions require **human approval**
- All decisions are **auditable and reversible**
- Clear accountability through decision ownership

---

## Business Impact (Simulated Enterprise Environment)
- Improved executive trust in AI-driven decisions
- Reduced decision latency for high-risk scenarios
- Clear separation between AI recommendation and human authority
- Enhanced visibility into enterprise risk posture
